I'll have to write about this properly later, but I feel like I have to include this book, even though I've not read it recently, because I wrote my undergraduate dissertation about and still think about it today.

A few themes, which I think will resurface throughout the notes on this website:

- taking part in a well established literary tradition like Romance allows you to make big statements through small abberations. Lots of the individual tales and quests in the Morte Darthur conform to a very recognisable format. For instance, in the tale of Sir Gareth a damsel comes to court seeking help, an unknown young squire is sent out to prove himself in her aid, and he turns out to be of the noblest bloodline in the land. The actual plot of Gareth's tale is predictable because it appears elsewhere in the canon, but digressions from form - like the damsel's non-stop criticism of Gareth even after he's saved her skin - are hilarious and take on unusual significance.
- individual vs dividual. Really interesting stuff about honour and shame, and the extent to which it is earned by an indiviudal and conferred to the community. A knight beats some foes and sends them begging back to Camelot - his honour is shared - but his shame is borne in solitude under a *hayre shirte*.
- Mallory is thought to have been in prison himself when he wrote the Morte in the late 15th century, and in prologues to the eight or so books of the tale he asks readers to look kindly on him, a 'Knight-Prisoner'. His stories are about acts of courage etc. but they're also suffuse with male pride, shame and weakness. It's difficult to tell if Mallory is suggesting his own acts (cattle rustling, ambushes, rape) are reasonable and human acts, or if unerring virtue is something that exists only in stories, or if he genuinely wants to repent.
