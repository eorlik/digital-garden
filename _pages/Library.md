# Library

Here I'll record books that I've been reading, and if I get around to it I'll try to include a few lines about each of them.
Ultimately, I'd like this to be displayed as a responsive grid of book cover images, which you can click through to reach my reviews, or hover over for a precis.

I'll take [Maggie Appleton's digital library](https://maggieappleton.com/library/) as inspiration, whose site I mentioned in *[[take a rake to it]]*

Right now I'm starting to read *Letters to a Young Poet* by Rilke, and I'm *just* about to start reading *Lanny* by Max Porter. Here are the latest books I've actually finished, or at least made some headway on:

<div style="padding: 1em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">

    <ul>
        <li>The Mirror and the Light</li>
        <li>This Mournable Body</li>
        <li>The Internet in Everything</li>
        <li>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</li>
        <li>Citadel</li>
        <li>Entangled Life</li>
        <li>A Little Life</li>
        <li>China: The Bubble that Never Pops</li>
        <li>Exhalation</li>
        <li>Our Man in Havana</li>
        <li>Modern Nature</li>
        <li>The Ghost Map</li>
    </ul>
