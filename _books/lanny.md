A really gorgeous book, joyful and distressing which revels in the sacred and profane of Englishness.

The character of Dead Papa Toothwort, this mystical, powerful and mostly quite comical character haunts the book. He is a shapeshifter, and a chimera of old and new England — centuries old, one with nature, but sometimes assimilating detritus and urban rot.

I love this portrayal of the English countryside, meshing quaint cottages and woodlands with crisp packets in hedgerows and petty vandalism. It looks for beauty in every aspect.


When Papa Toothwort tunes into the domestic conversations of the villagers, the book's layout and typography imitates the hubbub.

I love playful layouts.

    <strong>Note to self.</strong><br>Worth doing a bit of a feature at some point on books which play with their medium Tristram Shandy, Building Stories, also B. S. Johnson's [<i>The Unfortunates</i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unfortunates) which comes as sixty or so seperately bound and unnumbered chapters.
</span> In [Tristram Shandy](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1079) Lawrence Sterne made great use of its printed matter in a playful way, and Chris Ware's [Building Stories](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/21/building-stories-chris-ware-review) takes things even further, with a graphic novel made up of a dozen or so booklets, each unique in size and feel, embracing and playing with their form.

I've been dreaming of doing something similar with this website when I get to grips with coding it — building on the margin notes and bidirectional links that I've already set up, and think more deeply about how best to mingle form and content.
