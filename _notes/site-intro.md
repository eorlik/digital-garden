title: What's this site for?

I set up this site as a place to display art projects but quickly took a left turn when I learned about digital gardens, like [Maggie Appleton’s](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) and [Tom Critchlow’s](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/) experiments in open note taking which I see as a way of mapping and building on the things I think about, am inspired about, and make.

This is a hand-coded static site, built with Jekyll, and hosted on GitHub via Netlify. I'm not a coder *at all*, but I'm really excited about trying stuff out, making mistakes and learning some new skills.

I’d like to include:

📚 A library of books I’ve been reading with at least a sentence or two on what I think about them.

🎨 a selection of my art projects, linked to…

💡 posts about the ideas or artworks or experiences that I think have influenced them.

🧐 commentaries on articles and projects I’ve found on the web

💻 a catalogue of the tabs I’ve had open in my browser for weeks but not got around to properly reading

✏️ half-formed musings and ideas
