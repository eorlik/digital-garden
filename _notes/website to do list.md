# To do:

### Make the navigation links collapse into a hamburger on smaller viewports

### Book layout
Make book covers in the book layout responsive (e.g. disappearing on small screens)

### Add some images
Store images on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) or similar

### Work out how to make bidirectional links work within styled HTML
At the moment, if you try to use the bidirectional link function from within a styled paragraph or list it doesn't work.

# Tools to explore
