Rilke was very serious! This is a series of letters to the young poet Franz Kappus (but without Kappus's responses in my edition). They consist mostly of an apology (&ldquo;sorry this is so late &ndash; I was distracted by my travels/sickness/ennui/climate&rdquo;) a comment on some writing sent by Kappus, and some general advice about God, love and most of all solitude. Rilke's counsel speaks to me &ndash; I've found that solitude is important in order to be creative, if only because it means fewer distractions.


I'm not sure about Rilke's advice on love, though... Clearly affectionate towards his proteg√©, to me Rilke seems to look past what seems to be Kappus's obvious loneliness and counsels him that sad solitude is the *only* way to live as an artist, and that the thing that most people describe as 'love' is in fact a pale imitation of the real thing, which must be experienced alone. I think poor Kappus just needed a hug.

One side note. Rilke was an aquaintance of artists including Rodin, whom he thought the greatest living sculptor, and it seems a distant Orlik. Here is a caricature of Rilke by my distant cousin Emil Orlik clearly made before he grew the crusty beard in the cover image of my edition of the *Letters*.
