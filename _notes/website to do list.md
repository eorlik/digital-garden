# To do:

### Make the navigation links collapse into a hamburger on smaller viewports

### Create a fancy pants contents page to hold my notes

### Create library section
Turn the Library page into a responsive, animated grid of images which link through to reviews etc. Create a sensible file structure to organise this.

### Add some images
Store images on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) or similar

### Work out how to make bidirectional links work within styled HTML
At the moment, if you try to use the bidirectional link function from within a styled paragraph or list it doesn't work.
