# Library

Here I'll record books that I've been reading, and if I get around to it I'll try to include a few lines about each of them.

I'll take [Maggie Appleton's digital library](https://maggieappleton.com/library/) as inspiration, whose site I mentioned in [[site intro|another note]].

Right now I'm starting to read *Letters to a Young Poet* by Rilke. Here are the latest books I've actually finished, or at least made some headway on:
