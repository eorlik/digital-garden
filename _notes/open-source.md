# Open Source is Amazing

To anyone who has ever thought about open source software even for a moment, this would probably seem like such a basic realisation, but I'm coming to understand just how wonderful OSS is.

Over the past couple of months, I've been picking up some javascript skills, building a website using Jekyll and making a tasty-looking donut on Blender and I'm now in awe of the passionate people and online communities who invent, develop and teach OS software basically out of love.

Obviously, I've been using [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org) for years, but it's only when I recently downloaded [maps.me](https://maps.me) on a walking holiday, which uses [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org) as the source of its data, that I started contributing to OS projects - adding opening hours and parking information about my local Turkish supermarket. 

I can see how this could become compulsive and wonderfully social behaviour: open source tools make it easy to fix typos or citations in wikipedia articles, for example, and as with coding for the web it's incredible satisfying to see your adjustments reflected in a public place. I wonder if graffiti artists feel the same way when they tag something and admire their work.

Naturally, I'm thinking about how I might be able to apply open source principles to my own work in the civil service: basically by creating tools that people _want_ to contribute to, and making it easy and instantly gratifying for them to do so. 

Recently I've been working on a people-finding tool which I'm calling Tech Trumps, to help find people working on tech issues across government. It's an offline HTML file with links to CDN-hosted Javascript and CSS documents (also made by me) to provide functionality and styles without bulking out the file. And I think it's ripe for collective, creative input from the amazing people I work with.

The challenge, I feel, is getting it right first time. It's taken me years to dip my toe into contributing to OS projects, which tells me that they can be daunting or feel exclusive. For Tech Trumps to work, it does feel like the benchmark needs to be high - the initial product ought to look good, feel good, and be fun/easy to contribute to.

I'll update this note as it develops...
