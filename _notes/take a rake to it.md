title: Take a rake to it
---

I set up this site as a place to display art projects but quickly took a left turn when I learned about digital gardens, like [Maggie Appleton’s](https://maggieappleton.com/garden) and [Tom Critchlow’s](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/) experiments in open note taking which I see as a way of mapping and building on the things I think about, am inspired about, and make.

This site is made with godaddy’s managed WordPress service which isn’t very flexible and I’m weighing up whether to switch to basic hosting and try to get to grips with some coding – all the best gardens look like they’re custom built and cobbled together with open source tools and templates. I’m not a coder so it’s daunting.

For now, I’ll try to keep it simple and use WordPress’s native filing tools (tags, categories, posts etc) and judicious linking between different posts.

I’d like to include:

📚 A library of books I’ve been reading with at least a sentence or two on what I think about them.

🎨 a selection of my art projects, linked to…

💡 posts about the ideas or artworks or experiences that I think have influenced them.

🧐 commentaries on articles and projects I’ve found on the web

💻 a catalogue of the tabs I’ve had open in my browser for weeks but not got around to properly reading

✏️ half-formed musings and ideas

[[Your first seed]]
