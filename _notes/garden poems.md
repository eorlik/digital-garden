Every few years I seem to try my hand at poetry again. Here are three poems from July 2019 which I’ve just found while tidying up my desktop.

## Vine Eyes 

 Shopping in B&Q for pinks,<br>
 I recalled a wedge-shaped  <br>
 sort of nail my neighbours had, <br> 
 which they’d used to hold up  <br>
 wire for plants, against their wall.<br>
 
 
 Wedge shaped nail:  <br>
 I tried to find its formal name<br>
 on Google, on my phone, sat<br>
 on a pallet of stacked trellises.<br>
 
 
 Permutations later,  <br>
 necessary to get beyond  <br>
 manicures and fungal infections –<br>
 ‘Vine Eye’ – I’d found it,<br>
 stubborn shank of steel<br>
 whose name belies it, but<br>
 is beautiful nonetheless.<br>
 
 
 In the ironware aisle,<br>
 I scanned from side to side  <br>
 like an umpire to no avail:<br>
 Vine Eyes unstocked! 

<br><br>

## The Undertoad 

Trailing edge of pondweed,<br>
under which at least one frog is hiding<br>
from me, the flirt.<br>
I’m done with playing games, 
and scatter my new slug pellets across the patio.<br>

Last week I had a visit from Ananya.<br> 
We had a whale of a time  <br>
salting the bastards as they thundered in their own sweet time  <br>
out of the undergrowth and towards  <br>
my new peony;<br>
geranium;<br>
sweet pea;<br>
silverbush;<br>
the garlic I planted from bulb.<br>
Only the cinquefoil was left untasted:<br>
in this context, a weed.  

<br><br>

## Nothing so lovely

 Nothing so grubby as the buttons on this photocopier.<br>
 Nothing so pointless as this swivel chair,
       which I spin in by the hour.<br>
 Nothing so slow as the hours passing 
       before I can respectably leave work<br>
&emsp; and phone you from my sofa, <br>
&emsp; with a blanket covering my toes.
