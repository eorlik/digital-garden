title: Shame for sale
---

I’ve been thinking about NFTs over the last few weeks. People are selling digital copies of GIFs and digital art for a lot of money; even before that, the [NBA was selling NFTs](https://nbatopshot.com/) associated with hot moves from past basketball games, which collectors would pay a lot for.

Putting aside the technical affordances of the blockchain (e.g. smart contracts that slip royalties to the artist each time an NFT for her work is resold), how are NFTs (legal property with no inherent value) any different from trading cards, whose value is sentimental and/or speculative, or certificates of authenticity, which are intrinsically worthless but confer value on the artwork – a print, photo, film – that they are verifying?

Certificates come into play as important auxiliaries to valuable artworks. They are valuable insofar as they demonstrate the authenticity of an artwork but nobody is pretending that the certificate itself has any worth. But for collectors who are spending loads on NFT art, the collectible object itself – Nyan cat GIF, Jack Dorsey’s first tweet – seems almost to be incidental.

This is a reversal – in which the token is the valuable thing, and the tokenised item acts mostly as proof of work. Given the scarcity of NFTs and the non-rivalrous nature of tweets and GIFs, this inversion is bizarre but logical: you might go to an auction and spend thousands on a certificate, and be given an original (but worthless because endlessly duplicable) digital artwork as the proof that your certificate is valuable.

What makes a trading card, like a rare Pokemon card, valuable to a collector? Two things: authority and scarcity. The card has to be issued by someone that the collector thinks is authoritative, and its value is roughly proportional to its scarcity. A counterfeit card ceases to have value once the fraud is found out; the value of a rare item goes down if a cache of comparable items is uncovered.

The NBA is the authority for basketball fans, and that’s why they can sell Michael Jordan’s slam dunks as collectibles, even though they’re free for all to watch on youtube. But Michael Jordan is also a recognisable authority on his own slam dunks, so if he minted his own NFTs for the same slam dunks, they’d probably be worth something. Kevin Roose [minted an NFT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/technology/nft-column-blockchain.html) for one his *New York Times* columns, which [sold for 350 Ethereum](https://foundation.app/kevinroose/the-new-york-times-x-nft-13129) (about £430k!).<label for="note to self" class="margin-toggle"><sup>&#8224;</sup></label>

I realised that I could tokenise my own lived experiences if I wanted to, and offer those for sale as NFTs. I am the only authority over my own experience, and can obviously control the supply of those experiences I offer up for sale. That said, I would want to pick a naturally scarce experience to tokenise: my most shameful moments.

I will tokenise my seven most shameful experiences and sell them, allowing them to reach their full market value at auction. Bidders have the chance to own a piece of my shame, but like MJ’s dunks, they won’t necessarily experience it any differently from anyone else; the value comes in the scarcity – they will uniquely own my experience – and the authority – I certify that the NFT confers ownership of one of my genuinely shameful experiences.

This is a win-win for me. It profits nobody to hold onto their personal shame. Shame, in the abstract is a useful social tool for encouraging pro-social behaviour, but it’s a bummer for the individual. I’d like to profit, spiritually and financially from letting that shame go. I’ll also get a cut each time one of the NFTs changes hands. Win-win-win!
